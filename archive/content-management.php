<p>Websites are made of text (we call it copy), images and code. The text and images are referred to as the <strong>content</strong> of the website. </p>
<p>Each person who has a website or is thinking about having a website needs to think seriously about what content they will post on the site and how that content will change over time. While thinking that over, consider who will do the writing, how often you plan on updating the content and whether you want to blog or not. Having answers to these questions will comprise your "Content Management Plan".</p>
<p>Your content management plan will help you shop for hosting services that meet your needs and can inform our discussion of how to best use technology to run your website.</p>
<h2>Content Management Services</h2>
<p>I offer two ways to manage web content for my clients. </p>
<h2>Web Publishing</h2>
<p>For clients who have a simple website, they email me their content and I publish it for them. This is a simple solution and results in a very fast and secure website.</p>
<h2>WordPress</h2>
<p>For clients who want frequent, real-time updates to their website and/or blogging, I provide WordPress as a content management platform. WordPress is a great system but it requires a decent level of technical proficiency to use it effectively.</p>
