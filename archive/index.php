<p class="proud">Providence Pixelworks is a small web design shop whose focus is on providing innovative solutions that meet client needs. For the most part, I (Tim Thorp) work alone but I also collaborate with a select group of trusted, talented colleagues when a project will benefit from their contributions. <a href="about">Learn More About Tim and Providence Pixelworks&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

<h2>&#8470; 1: Partnership</h2>
<p>Not every web design shop offers the same level of service. I'm not going to say, "I'm better because of blah, blah..." because what is <em>better</em> depends on <em>your needs</em>. For example, if your primary goal is a low price, you may be better off getting a designer from craigslist and hosting from godaddy. On the other hand, if you have been thinking about how to use the web as a marketing tool that can help you attract and retain customers, we should talk.</p>
<p>When I started doing web design and hosting, my idea was to <strong>partner with small business owners</strong> to build and run a website that conveys value to their audience. To this day, I find that goal challenging and interesting. Along the way, I have made some good friends with my clients and enjoy being there for them as their goals evolve.</p>
